# Snaps for Progress

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To compile LESS changes (still need to put in middleware)
```sh
$ lessc main.less  > compiled/main.css
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
